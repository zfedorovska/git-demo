life is beautiful
life is a gift
standing strong
to be happy

form the lines
shield by shield

never look back

"Nothing Else Matters"

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
